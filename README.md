# 🗂 Kanban Board – Frontend Engineering Assignment

A simplified **Kanban Board Application** built using **React + Tailwind CSS** with a strong focus on **Optimistic UI Updates, Robust State Management, and Clean User Experience**.

This project demonstrates how to manage asynchronous operations, UI consistency, and rollback mechanisms without using a real backend.

## ✨ Features

- 🔐 Mock Authentication (No Backend)
- 💾 Persistent Login using LocalStorage
- 📋 Three Kanban Columns
  - To Do
  - In Progress
  - Done
- ➕ Add Tasks
- 🔄 Move Tasks Between Columns
- ❌ Delete Tasks
- ⚡ Optimistic UI Updates
- ⏳ Mock API Delay (1–2 Seconds)
- 🎲 Random API Failure (20%)
- 🔁 Automatic Rollback on Failure
- 🔔 Toast Error Notifications
- 📱 Responsive & Minimal UI Design

## 🧠 Core Engineering Concepts

### Optimistic UI
User actions update the interface instantly without waiting for server response, creating a zero-latency experience.

### Rollback Mechanism
If the simulated API fails, the UI automatically restores the previous state to maintain data consistency.

### Asynchronous Handling
All add, move, and delete actions simulate network delay using Promises and `setTimeout`.

### Centralized State Management
Handled using **Zustand** to efficiently manage complex state updates and rollbacks.

## ⚙️ Installation & Running

```bash
npm install
npm run dev

---

## 🔐 Authentication Logic

- Accepts any **non-empty username/email**
- Stored in **LocalStorage**
- Page refresh does **not** log out the user
- Logout clears **LocalStorage**

## 📡 Mock API Behavior

| Property | Value |
|---------|------|
| Delay | 1–2 Seconds |
| Failure Rate | 20% Random |
| Affected Actions | Add, Move, Delete |
| On Failure | Toast Notification + UI Rollback |

---

## 🔄 Optimistic Update Flow

1. User performs an action (Add / Move / Delete)
2. UI updates immediately
3. Mock API request begins in background
4. If API succeeds → state remains unchanged
5. If API fails → previous state restored automatically
